					Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics
				</h2>

				<!-- <div class="approachOne-subheading "> -->

					<!-- <p>I have been working with the Brain Physics Lab at the University of Cambridge on a computational project that aims to optimize the mathematical model of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics in order to improve diagnostics for CSF disorders.</p>

						<p>We use mathematical modeling to analyze CSF infusion studies and estimate a number of diagnostic parameters such as reference intracranial pressure (ICP), CSF formation rate, resistance to CSF outflow and brain elastance coefficient. This is done by fitting an analytical solution to the non-linear differential equation describing the Marmarou model to measurement data and thus optimizing values of the parameters. However, this process can lead to estimated values that lie outside of physiologically permissible ranges due to the problem of local minima.</p>
						
						<p>In this research, we propose an improvement to the gradient descent methods used in ICM+ by using advanced optimization techniques to improve the estimation of the diagnostic parameters, ensuring that the results fall within physiologically acceptable ranges.</p>

						<p>We have developed a new Bayesian method to improve the estimation of diagnostic parameters. This method is based on Bayesian statistics, which is a way of combining information from prior knowledge with new observations to make predictions. One of the main advantages of our Bayesian method is that it can provide uncertainty estimates on the optimized parameter values. This means that it can tell us how confident it is in its predictions, which is very useful when dealing with complex clinical and statistical models.</p>

						<p>For example, when it comes to making clinical decisions, knowing the level of uncertainty is crucial. Our new Bayesian method offers a more robust and informative way to model the data, because it can take into account uncertainty, providing a more accurate prediction of the model and helping to inform clinical decisions.</p>

						<p>Finally, the uncertainty predictions provided by the new Bayesian method can also be used in the design of future clinical studies and in the interpretation of the results, allowing to account for the possible variation in the parameters and make more accurate predictions. It provides a more realistic representation of the complexity of the data and more accurate estimation of the parameters, by taking into account the possible variations in the data. </p> -->

					the Division of Neurosurgery at the University of Cambridge. My current computational project with
					Dr. Peter Smielewski (Principal Investigator) and Dr. Alexis Joannides (Honorary Consultant
					Neurosurgeon) investigates optimising the mathematical model of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in
					order to improve diagnostics of CSF disorders.</p> -->

					

				<!-- <p>By analysing CSF infusion studies using a mathematical model of CSF dynamics, it is possible to
					estimate a number of diagnostic parameters: reference ICP (\(P_0\)), CSF formation rate (\(I_f\)),
					resistance to CSF outflow (\(R_{out}\)), and brain elastance coefficient (\(E\)). This is done by fitting
					an analytical solution to the non-linear differential equation describing the Marmarou model to
					measurement data, thus optimising values of \(R_{out}\), \(E\) and \(P_0\). However, these estimations may
					produce values that lie outside of physiologically permissible ranges e.g. due to the problem of
					local minima.
					In the current work, we propose an improvement to the gradient descent methods used in ICM+ by
					employing:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Hybrid nonlinear optimisation with penalties and transformation of objective variables</li>
					<li>Bayesian optimisation framework.</li>
				</ul> -->
