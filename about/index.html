					About me
				</h2>

				<div class="approachOne-subheading ">

					<p> I am a penultimate year clinical student at the University of Cambridge interested in medicine
						and technology. My expertise
						includes the development and implementation of new computational research tools for biomedical
						data analysis. Currently, I am seeking opportunities that will allow me to advance and promote
						technologies in the fields of neural engineering, neurosurgery, and brain physics.
					</p>

					<p> During my undergraduate degree in Physiology, Development and Neuroscience at Cambridge, I have
						focussed on early cortical neurodevelopment at cellular scale, taking relevant modules from
						across all Neuroscience. These included evo-devo neurobiology, molecular & cellular
						neuroscience, local circuits and neural networks, and neural degeneration & regeneration. </p>

					<p>My undergraduate thesis with Dr. Susanna Mierau (Principal Investigator at Brigham and Women's
						Hospital and Harvard Medical School) investigated the emergence of network dynamics in
						developing cortical cultures using microelectrode array (MEA) recordings. It involved creating a
						novel spike detection method, developing tools for the analysis of cellular level functional
						connectivity, and exploring network dynamics using approaches from control engineering. I now
						continue my work, extending it from 2D cultures to 3D human cerebral and spinal cord organoids.
						I also help managing the group's website and codebase, and contribute to collaborations across
						several Cambridge departments (Chemical Engineering, Clinical Neurosciences, Applied
						Mathematics, Engineering) and internationally (Tampere University, Finland; Harvard University,
						USA).
					</p>

					<p> My other clinical and research interest is Neurosurgery. Since my Student Selected Component
						last spring, I have been working with the Brain Physics Lab in the Division of Neurosurgery at
						the University of Cambridge. My current computational project with Dr. Peter Smielewski
						(Principal Investigator) and Dr. Alexis Joannides (Honorary Consultant Neurosurgeon)
						investigates optimising the mathematical model of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in order to
						improve diagnostics of CSF disorders.</p>

					<p> Throughout my research, I have been inspired by the books “Neural Control Engineering: The
						Emerging Intersection between Control Theory and Neuroscience” by Schiff, and “Neuroengineering”
						by DiLorenzo and Bronzino. Now, I would like to get involved in research on neural engineering,
						which would ultimately bring together all of my passions: electrophysiology and microelectrode
						arrays, computational neuroscience, neural network dynamics, biomedical engineering and
						Neurosurgery. I am especially interested in the current work on deep brain stimulation (DBS),
						brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and neuroprosthetics. My dream is to become an Academic
						Functional Neurosurgeon.</p>
