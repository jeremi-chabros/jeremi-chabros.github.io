					About me
				</h2>

				<div class="approachOne-subheading ">

					<p>I am a highly skilled clinical student at the University of Cambridge with a passion for medicine
						and technology. My expertise includes the development and implementation of innovative
						computational research tools for biomedical data analysis. I am seeking opportunities to advance
						and promote technologies in the fields of neural engineering, neurosurgery, and brain physics.
					</p>

					<p>During my undergraduate studies in Physiology, Development and Neuroscience at Cambridge, I
						focused on early cortical neurodevelopment at the cellular level, taking courses in evo-devo
						neurobiology, molecular and cellular neuroscience, local circuits and neural networks, and
						neural degeneration and regeneration.</p>

					<p>For my undergraduate thesis, I worked with Dr. Susanna Mierau (Principal Investigator at Brigham
						and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School) to investigate the emergence of network
						dynamics in developing cortical cultures using microelectrode array (MEA) recordings. This
						involved creating a novel spike detection method, developing tools for the analysis of
						cellular-level functional connectivity, and exploring network dynamics using approaches from
						control engineering. I am currently extending this work from 2D cultures to 3D human cerebral
						and spinal cord organoids. In addition, I am responsible for managing the group's website and
						codebase, and I contribute to collaborations across several Cambridge departments (Chemical
						Engineering, Clinical Neurosciences, Applied Mathematics, Engineering) and internationally
						(Tampere University, Finland; Harvard University, USA).</p>

					<p>I also have a strong interest in neurosurgery. Since my Student Selected Component last spring, I
						have been working with the Brain Physics Lab in the Division of Neurosurgery at the University
						of Cambridge. My current computational project with Dr. Peter Smielewski (Principal
						Investigator) and Dr. Alexis Joannides (Honorary Consultant Neurosurgeon) focuses on optimizing
						the mathematical model of cerebrospinal fluid dynamics to improve diagnostics of CSF disorders.
					</p>

					<p>I have been inspired by the works "Neural Control Engineering: The Emerging Intersection between
						Control Theory and Neuroscience" by Schiff and "Neuroengineering" by DiLorenzo and Bronzino, and
						I am particularly interested in the current research on deep brain stimulation (DBS),
						brain-computer interfaces (BCI), and neuroprosthetics. As a future academic functional
						neurosurgeon, I hope to bring together my passions for electrophysiology and microelectrode
						arrays, computational neuroscience, neural network dynamics, biomedical engineering, and
						neurosurgery.</p>

				<h4>Neuranatomy section of the Brain Bee World Championship in Copenhagen. It did not go that well!
					However, I scored 100% in the 'Patient Diagnosis' section later that day, which really sparked my
					passion for clinical neurosciences that drives me to this day. (2016)</h4>

				<h4>Society of British Neurological Surgeons, Cork, Ireland. It was my first serious neurosurgical
					conference! I was extremely stressed about presenting my research but it all turned out just fine.
					An amazing opportunity for networking with students and neurosurgeons from all levels of training.

				<h4>My work on neurotrauma made it to the top 5 in the Gordon Holmes Prize in Clinical Neurosciences run
					by the Royal Society of Medicine. I had the privilege to present my findings to the broader
					audience. Did not manage to come on top, but I will be back! (2023)</h4>
